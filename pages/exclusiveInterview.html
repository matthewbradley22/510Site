        <p class="question">
            When did you decide you wanted to be part of 510?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            When I realized it would be really hard to have 6 you-know-whats in 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            What was going on in your life around the time you had this realization?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Not much. Mostly sitting either on Lauren and Andrew’s couch, or our own couch. 
            Slapping ghost’s ass. We were really bumming it back then, leaks in the ceiling,
             Matthew in the backyard trying to grow food, we didn’t have much, but that kind 
             of situation forces you to have a lot of heart and grit.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            Do you ever consider quitting? Or you’re committed for the yearly bit? I mean, this seems like a physically grueling process
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I would never quit
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            What drives you to keep going then?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            I want to push boundaries. I want to be remembered for something. One thing 
            that always irks me is people that seem to accept limits just because they were 
            told they existed. I think Tyler said it best – “I hate wasted potential, that 
            shit breaks your spirit”
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            What makes you a good competitor in 510 compared to everyone else? Do you bring anything special to the table?
        </p>
         <p class="answer">
            People know my limitations, I do my best with the 80 but it’s not where I 
            shine. But honestly, I think that’s a good thing when you zoom out. We’re like 
            a eusocial being once this thing starts, you need a division of labor, 
            specialization. Honestly, the 80 is glamorous, people see you chugging 24 beers 
            or whatever, but every number is difficult in its own right and I think I bring
             an enthusiasm and intelligence that powers us in a special way.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            It’s funny you mention intelligence. Do you think it holds you back doing 
            this with a team that is only half PhDs?
         </p>
          <p class="answer">
            That’s for coach to decide, I’m here to play.
          </p>
          <p class="question">
            How does your family feel about you doing this every year?
          </p>
           <p class="answer">
            I do it all for them, if they didn’t support me I would stop in a heartbeat.
           </p>
            <p class="question">
                How do you feel about hosting in your hometown?
            </p>
             <p class="answer">
                I spent years running competitively in Prescott, and I learned a lot of 
                lessons. Work the hills, get in your opponent’s heads, pace yourself. The
                 challenge is the same. When I smell the pine air of Prescott, lay my eyes 
                 on Thumb Butte, I have no doubt that I’ll be able to bring an energy that’s new
                compared to previous years.
             </p>
             <p class="question">
                How do you feel going into this year? Do you expect to set a new record, even at this altitude?
             </p>
              <p class="question">
                Finally, can you predict your teammate’s vibes for this year? What position do you anticipate 
                they’ll each be playing?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Emily’s like a center midfielder. She can read the whole field, make adjustments, 
                pass to the open players. She keeps the gears turning, and if we need it, she can also score 
                the big goal. Andrew’s more like a tennis player, he knows it’s a long match and he’s going 
                the whole time. Never too high or too low, always a beer in hand, and keeps the composure for
                 the whole group in some ways. Lauren foosball, Matthew curling, Jordan what again?
