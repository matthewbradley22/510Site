            <p class="playerCardText">Meet <b>Lauren</b>. Known for her 
            courageous efforts in roles that no one else will fill such
            as spicy ramen eater while still carrying a heavy load of 
            beer drinking and glizzy eating. She is also to thank
            for the most cerebral task each year, keeping 
            track of how many photographs have been taken. The average
            510 member does not have the wherewithal for such tasks, for this we thank her.

            <p class="playerCardText">Meet <b>Andrew</b>. Known for elite 
                levels of beer chugging in his debut 510 two years ago,
                he has played a key role in both 510 victories. He can also more 
                than carry his weight in glizzy gobbling and the diverse array 
                of 160s that were present in year 2 (thank you <span style="color:rgb(222, 44, 202);">Andy Candy</span>).

            <p class="playerCardText">Meet <b>Emily</b>. After a breakout
                performance last year with <b>24 BEERS</b> she has gained
                a reputation as someone who will always step up when needed.
                You can find Emily at any of the 510 stations lending a hand,
                and we don't know where we would be without her.

            <p class="playerCardText">Meet <b>Myra</b>. The Glizzy goblin 
                herself needs no introduction. Her reputation precedes her and we
                can count on her to shoulder the load of several 510 sections by herself.
                Besides this, she holds the 510 record for glizzies in a mouth at once 
                (roughly 8!)!

            <p class="playerCardText">Meet <b>Jordan</b>. 
                Jordan hips where others hop. She is a core member of 
                the 10 duo with Myra Dickey, and without her this section 
                of the challenge would be drastically different. She also 
                carries her weight in other sections with a standout performance 
                year 1 chugging watermelon juice.

                A 510 chameleon, willing to hop in where necessary,
                even if it won't show up on the stat sheet. Matthew 
                has shown his passion and importance to 510 through beer drinking,
                spicy ramen eating, and website building.
